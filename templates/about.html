    <h2>About LifePredictor</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      LifePredictor is a web application designed to provide quick insights into life expectancy based on demographic and environmental metrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using historical global data, including GDP per capita, CO₂ emissions, and child mortality rates, our model predicts an indicative life expectancy. While it is a simplification of real-world health outcomes, it helps visualize the impact of key factors.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project was developed as part of a bootcamp to explore the intersection of data science, web development, and societal insights. Its goal is educational: to demonstrate how data can inform understanding of public health challenges worldwide.
    </p>

    <p class="muted small">
      Predictions are illustrative, not medical advice. Real-world decisions require comprehensive research and expert consultation.
